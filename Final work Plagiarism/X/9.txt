    geography   (from  greek :  γεωγραφία ,  geographia , literally "earth description") is a field of  science  devoted to the study of the lands, features, inhabitants, and phenomena of the  earth  and  planets.  the first person to use the word γεωγραφία was  eratosthenes  (276–194 bc). geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of earth and  its human and natural complexities —not merely where objects are, but also how they have changed and come to be.
  geography is often defined in terms of two branches:  human geography  and  physical geography . human geography deals with the study of people and their communities, cultures, economies, and interactions with the environment by studying their relations with and across space and place. physical geography deals with the study of processes and patterns in the natural environment like the  atmosphere ,  hydrosphere ,  biosphere , and  geosphere .
